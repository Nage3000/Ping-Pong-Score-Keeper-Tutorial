# Ping Pong Score Keeper Tutorial
 
One of my very first JavaScript tutorials, done with Colt Steele in his "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2020" series on UDemy. 

This is a simple score keeper for an imaginary ping pong situation. 

The Javascript I learned over the last few lessons was a great insight into how computer logic works with the JS language. This score keeper was a good trial on using basic logic with the different concepts taught by Colt. The JS file was also refractored at the end of the tutorial, which completely changed my perspective on how to use objects and arrays inside the logic. 

The HTML also includes my first use of Bulma, a CSS framework in direct competition to Bootstrap. While I enjoyed Bulma, I felt it was much less concise than Bootstrap; and from my last Loruki project I would much rather build my own framework as I did in that tutorial.
